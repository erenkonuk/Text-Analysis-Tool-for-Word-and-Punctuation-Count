Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth’s surface observed since the
        pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily
        fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s
        atmosphere. This term is not interchangeable with the term "climate change".
        Since the pre-industrial period, human activities are estimated to have increased
        Earth’s global average temperature by about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit),
        a number that is currently increasing by more than 0.2 degrees Celsius (0.36 degrees
        Fahrenheit) per decade. The current warming trend is unequivocally the result of human
        activity since the 1950s and is proceeding at an unprecedented rate over millennia.
